Contemporary paper submission platforms necessitate users to upload paper titles and abstracts, followed by the selection of appropriate categories for their submissions. However, the multitude of available categories poses a challenge for authors seeking optimal classification. Imagine a submission system that not only streamlines this process but also enhances user experience by offering intelligent category suggestions based on the paper's content. The classifier is designed to perform multi-label classification to determine the appropriate research categories for a given paper based on its title and abstract.

## Features

Multi-label Classification: The model can assign multiple categories to a single research paper.
Pre-trained on arXiv Dataset: Utilizes a large dataset of research papers from arXiv to ensure accurate and robust classification.
Input: Takes the title and abstract of a research paper.
Output: Provides a list of categories that the research paper belongs to.


## Usage

The model is trained on a dataset of research papers from arXiv, a free distribution service and an open-access archive for scholarly articles in various fields of science.

## Model Details

The classifier is built using advanced machine learning techniques and leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models to achieve high accuracy in category prediction.
